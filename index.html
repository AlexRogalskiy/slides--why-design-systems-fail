						- Within all of those companies, I've seen multiple design systems emerge and try to call themselves the single source of truth.
						- At DigitalOcean, there are currently 3 floating around (because reasons), at various stages of use 
						- It's important to remember this very important XKCD cartoon, though when it comes to building new design systems:

						- When I did an Audit, I found that 96KB of the existing CSS was the design system
						- This was only 28% of the total CSS, signaling that most of the CSS was overrides and additional components
						- There were 57 unique font sizes, 14 z-indices, 121 unique color declarations, 19 unique font family declarations
						- So there was room for improvement
						- But most importantly, I wanted to know why people were adding on and not using the existing system
						- I think understanding this point is critical to the discussion of how to empower a company to grow via design systems
						- Because if you don't take usage and support into account, you're missing out on all of the benefits of your hard work building that system

					<h2>Happy Design Systems:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Scale Good Standards</li>
						<li class="fragment">Build-in Accessibility</li>
						<li class="fragment">Unify Component Style</li>
						<li class="fragment">Unify Component Code</li>
						<li class="fragment">Reduce Code Cruft</li>
						<li class="fragment">Speed Up Product Delivery</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- These are all good things – the happy path.
						- If you're wondering "how could developers not use a design system that exists when there are so many benefis?"
						- The answer is simple: We're all being judged on different things.
						- Most people aren't being judged on clean code, they need to build features, their job depends on it.
						- You have to separate that fact from your own OKRs and what you're evaluated on.
						- Everything you do needs to support your customer (the engineers) and their needs
						- And its not an easy task
						- So lets get started at looking at what we should be doing to have a successful design system

              - This is something that lives on the organizational level
              - **It's like working out**. 
              - Small incremental investments over time lead to big gains overall. 
              - If you invest _once_ in a design system (say, 3 months of overhauling it) but neglect to keep it up, you won't find much improvement after that immediate gratification
              - People will stop using it as it becomes out of sync with new designs and you'll end up with strange, floating bits of code that nobody is using
              - And then you'll find yourself in for _another_ round of large investment, but dreading going through the process since its fallen out of shape.

            scaling image -- talk about accessibility
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Also, because of how they scale, design systems can really make a large impact across the platform, making it extremely important to really invest in things like accessibility from the start
						- It's also important to have some kind of ownership, some person or team who is looking out for this
						- Having a dedicated person is a way to ensure investment in this is ongoing
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>2. Communication</h1>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Once you have resources and a plan to invest in a design system, its really important that this person or team acts as a bridge between design and engineering
						- Continuous communication is really important here
						- Remember that nobody wants to be told what to do or prescribed a solution, especially developers, who are used to a lot of autonomy (usually they get to choose their own tools at work)
						- There is a basic psychological reaction in which they will just shut down and stop listening
						- Despite how much control the other engineers have on the process, they need to *feel* like they have input, and *feel* heard
						- It's like percieved performance, except percieved involvement

				</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/grocery.jpg">
					<h1>3. Buy-in</h1>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- For all of the reasons I just went over, good communication is really important for getting buy-in from your users
						- You also need to get buy-in from product managment and design. 
						- It's a lot of people ops, which we'll hear a lot about in the next talk
						- You have to make them *want* to use your design system because then you can really win
						- & a really good way to get someome to want to use a product is to make it the path of least resistance, to *show* its value
						- *Showing* is more powerful than *telling*
						- So if you can, have developers use your product in a low-stakes situation where it provides clear benefits

					<h3>Hackathons are Candy to a Budding Design System</h3>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Hackathons are a great place to debut your design system
						- Having a hackathon internally at DigitalOcean was a perfect opportunity to:
						1. Evangelize for the design system
						2. See what people were using it for and struggling with (excellent user testing there)
						3. Get user feedback afterward on how to improve it
						- The feedback we got from that hackathon was really helpful in shaping what's become of our current iteration</aside>

						- After the hackathon, more people had heard about BUI, and word spread. 
						- This was my favorite moment that occured a few weeks after the hackathon. //explain + click

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- I've used Semantic versioning on all of the design systems I've ever worked on
						- It uses a system of Major.Minor.Patch for any updates
						- You can then tag released on Github with versioned updates and ensure that someone's app won't break unintentionally when there is an update
						- We also use this semantic versioning as a link with our design system assets to keep them in sync, with the same version number corresponding to both Sketch and code
						- For our built CDN assets, I'll talk about that more in a second, we run a deploy script that automatically created folders for each realease, as well as a `latest` folder if someone wanted the always-up-to-date version of the design system

					 <h1>5. Reduce Friction</h1> 
					<p>If it's harder for people to use than their current system, people won't use it</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Reducing friction kind of sums up all of the other points made here about empathy, communication, and thinking about your user when building a design system
						- You have to make your design system the path of least resistance, 
						- and that means lowering cognitive overhead of development, not adding to it
						- this could change some of the decisions you make, but if your design system is complicated and over-engineered, again, its not going to be used
						- With the new version of BUI, we provide a few options
						- Option 1, where users can implement it into a development environment and use Sass, select just the components they want to include, and extend the system using hooks.
						- That's the most performant and extensible output. Code is clean and everyone's happy.
						- But not everyone wants to work this way, including Sass a dependancy and learning a new syntax.
						- There is also the user who just wants to throw a link onto their page and have it look nice, and thats where our versioned built assets come in
						- What you want (option 1) may not be the path of least resistance for an engineer, and you always have to keep that user in mind

                - I just want to bring this slide up again to remind you about the basics -- its really about people
                - I hope that those lessons and tibits have shown you that a design system is only as effective as its adoption
                - Through investment, communication, buy-in, solid architecture, and removing friction, 
                - you can get developers excited to use your design system,
                - empowering them to build quickly and efficiently, and everyone wins.
