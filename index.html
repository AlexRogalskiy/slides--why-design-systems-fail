						- I've been working on design systems for over 3 years
						- Started at a startup, designing a pattern library
						- Joined IBM and worked on the Watson Design System
						- Moved over to BlueMix to work on the beginings of what eventually became Carbon
						- Now I work at DigitalOcean on BUI, our current design system
						- So I've had a little experience with design systems
					</aside>

						- So why weren't people using existing design systems?
						- I think understanding this point is critical to the discussion of how to empower a company to grow via design systems
						- Because if you don't take usage and support into account, you're missing out on all of the positives here

					<h2>Happy Design Systems:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scale Good Standards</li>
						<li>Build-in Accessibility</li>
						<li>Unify Component Style</li>
						<li>Unify Component Code</li>
						<li>Reduce Code Cruft</li>
						<li>Speed Up Product Delivery</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						These are all good things â€“ the happy path. So we should all be aligned behind those ideas. But that's not really what happens is it? Because engineers are judged on different criteria than designers. They need to push features out because their job depends on it. It's not that engineers are resistant to accessibility or scaling good standards, its just that this isn't what they're being evaluated on. If it gets in their way, guess what wins? Building the feature, and getting it pushed out.

					-- image here of the CSS audit --
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- This was the initial CSS audit I did. I found that about 20% of that was the style system (Buoy) nad 80% was overrides on it, or new product that just ignored it entirely, so I wanted to look into WHY. What had happened there? We had this design system in place nut nobody was using it, and it was actually doing more harm than good.
						- There was a big debate on whether or not we should go back and try to fix the outdated, somewhat broken system, OR if we instead should build a new one
						- There has to be reason to build a new one, if not -- you will end up with just another standard

				<section data-background="img/gym.jpg">
					<h1>Investment</h1>
					<p>To have a successful design system, you need to make a continuous effort to invest resources into it. </p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- **It's like working out**. 
						- Small incremental investments over time lead to big gains overall. 
						- If you invest once (say, 3 months of overhauling your design system), but neglect to keep it up, you'll find immediate gratification but won't see much improvement after that.
						- You're probably going to lose some of the gains you made as your codebase becomes messier and starts to stray from your original design system, and then you'll find yourself in for another round of large investment, but dreading going through the process because its fallen out of shape.
						- Because of how they scale, design systems can really make a large impact across the platform and thus its important to really invest in things like accessibility from the start
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					 <h1>Reduce Friction</h1> 
					<p>If its harder for people to use than their current system, people won't use it</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You have to make your design system the path of least resistance, lowering cognitive overhead of development, not adding to it. This is vital. A design system is intended to make development much more efficient, enforce a consistent style across sites, and allow for the developer to not worry as much about small decisions like naming and HTML semantics. These are already sorted out for them, meaning they can focus on building product.

						But if your design system is complicated and over-engineered, they may find it frustrating to use and go back to what they know, even if what they know is tacky. If you're a Sass expert, and based your system on complex hooks and functions, you better hope your user (the developer) is also a Sass expert, or wants to learn. This is often not the case. You need to talk to your audience.

						This is a mistake I've personally learned from. While the system was beautiful and performant, it was over engineered to an audience that just wanted class names and structure. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for you to talk to your audience.

						<li class="fragment">Listen.</li>
						<li class="fragment tomato">Make Your User Feel Heard.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Provide Options.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- I really want to emphasize this third point, of making your user (which luckily for us is usually the developers we work with) feel heard
						- So with BUI v2, we provide options -- there is option 1, where users can implement it using Sass, select just the components they want to include, and extend the system using hooks. That's the most performant and extensible output. But then there is also the user who just wants to throw a link onto their page and make it look pretty. A great usecase here is a hackathon.</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/hackathon.jpg">
					<h1>Hackathons are Candy to a Budding Design System</h1>
					<aside class="notes">Having a hackathon internally was a great opportunity to not only test our design system but also get really good user feedback as we did interviews afterward. Some of the feedback that we got was asking for more macro elements and layouts, which were really good points that we've since implemented</aside>

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- After the hackathon, more people had heard about it, and word spread. This was my favorite moment that occured a few days after the hackathon.
						- These kinds of moments, where people explore on their own are where you can really get people on your side and using the design system, helping their products scale and grow
						- And speaking of getting people on your side...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Buy-in</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						No engineer likes being told what to do in a presecriptive manner. A design systems team needs to keep this in mind. The product will be much more effective if you bring in stakeholders early on (and by stakeholders I mean the engineers that will be using the system). Ask for their input and really listen. This is a big lesson I learned lately. All the work you think is right and good means nothing if the people you are "selling" it to aren't sold. And if they have a say early on, then they become a part of your team. They want it to succeed. So never underestimate the power of buy-in.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Enforcement</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						But I do need to talk about enforcement of this as well. Someone has to be a decision maker here and say "okay everyone now use this design system to build". Ideally, with the engineers on your side, they will *want* to. They'll be excited to. But there are also a few tools you can put in place to help with cleanliness of code as they are implementing
					</aside>

					--> Stylelint
					--> HTML Lint 
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Semantic Versioning</h1>
					<p>Major.Minor.Patch</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- Something that really helps with implementation of design systems are keeping clean versions.
						- Semantic versioning is great for design systems
						- SemVer is where you denote any updates to the system via a system of Major.Minor.Patch
						- On all of the design systems I've worked on, we've implemented this
						- Updated a component's color? That's a minor release since it won't cause breaking changes that may affect layout or other components
						- Changing layout objects or markup was a Major release since this would be a breaking change, and to update to the next version, effort would need to be put into doing some visual regression testing to that things don't break
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					-- image of github releases --
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- With github, we can link to specific version releases
						- For our built CDN assets, we run a deploy script that automatically created folders for each realease, as well as a `latest` folder if someone wanted the always-up-to-date version of the design system
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Ownership</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ultimately, someone needs to own this. Our design system was initially under a front-end infrastructure team, but its since moved to the design org for a tighter collaboration, and we're looking into how to pull it out into its own product vertical. With this structure, we can open PRs on the system itself, but more importantly, we can also open PRs on where we see inconsistencies throughout the UI and we can allow for other people to file bugs and contribute
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Contribution</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						I want to wrap this up by talking about a contribution cycle. As your engineers are implementing the design system, there needs to be a way for them to continue to provide feedback.
					</aside>

					<blockquote style="color:white">"Empowering product growth with design systems"</blockquote>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- So this brings us back to our theme of tonight: "Empowering product growth with design systems"
						- I hope that those lessons learned have showed you that the key to this, to empowering product growth, is to empower and enable design system growth through investment, communication, solid architecture, buy-in, and reducing friction
						- When you make developers excited to use your design system, you then empower them to build quickly and efficiently, and everyone wins.
