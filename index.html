					organizational unity and stability via reusable code snippets and utility styles. They make prototyping a breeze, and provide
					a common language for both designers and developers. A design system is a culmination of several individual components:

            The first design system I built was for a school project. I was in a design class and we had to create a style guide for the product.

            The idea of digital style guides was brand new. This is definitely a more design-focused system -- with basics like colors, typography, and even image usage defined and documented. I used a fancy SVG effect in the intro because I thought it was cool.

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Within all of those companies, I've seen multiple design systems emerge and try to call themselves the single source of truth.
						- At DigitalOcean, there are currently 3 floating around (because reasons), at various stages of use 
						- It's important to remember this very important XKCD cartoon, though when it comes to building new design systems:
					</aside>

				<section data-background="white">
					<img src="img/competing standards.png" alt="">
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- The problem was with that first system — that people weren't using it, and this was causing code cruft

				<section>
					<img src="img/selectors.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- When I did an Audit, I found that 96KB of the existing CSS was the design system
						- This was only 28% of the total CSS, signaling that most of the CSS was overrides and additional components
						- There were 57 unique font sizes, 14 z-indices, 121 unique color declarations, 19 unique font family declarations
						- So there was room for improvement
						- But most importantly, I wanted to know why people were adding on and not using the existing system
						- I think understanding this point is critical to the discussion of how to empower a company to grow via design systems
						- Because if you don't take usage and support into account, you're missing out on all of the benefits of your hard work building that system

        <section>
          In order to prevent things like this, you can use CSS in JS, styled components, and proper naming conventions like BEM. Let me go through some of those and how they can prevent these sorts of issues

          <h1>What I've Learned</h1>
        </section>
				<section>
					<h2>Happy Design Systems:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Scale Good Standards</li>
						<li class="fragment">Build-in Accessibility</li>
						<li class="fragment">Unify Component Style</li>
						<li class="fragment">Unify Component Code</li>
						<li class="fragment">Reduce Code Cruft</li>
						<li class="fragment">Speed Up Product Delivery</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- These are all good things – the happy path.
						- If you're wondering "how could developers not use a design system that exists when there are so many benefis?"
						- The answer is simple: We're all being judged on different things.
						- Most people aren't being judged on clean code, they need to build features, their job depends on it.
						- You have to separate that fact from your own OKRs and what you're evaluated on.
						- Everything you do needs to support your customer (the engineers) and their needs
						- And its not an easy task
						- So lets get started at looking at what we should be doing to have a successful design system
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/gym.jpg">
					<h1>1. Investment</h1>
					<p>To have a successful design system, you need to make a continuous effort to invest resources into it.</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- This is something that lives on the organizational level
						- **It's like working out**. 
						- Small incremental investments over time lead to big gains overall. 
						- If you invest _once_ in a design system (say, 3 months of overhauling it) but neglect to keep it up, you won't find much improvement after that immediate gratification
						- People will stop using it as it becomes out of sync with new designs and you'll end up with strange, floating bits of code that nobody is using
						- And then you'll find yourself in for _another_ round of large investment, but dreading going through the process since its fallen out of shape.
						- Also, because of how they scale, design systems can really make a large impact across the platform, making it extremely important to really invest in things like accessibility from the start
						- It's also important to have some kind of ownership, some person or team who is looking out for this
						- Having a dedicated person is a way to ensure investment in this is ongoing
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>2. Communication</h1>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Once you have resources and a plan to invest in a design system, its really important that this person or team acts as a bridge between design and engineering
						- Continuous communication is really important here
						- Remember that nobody wants to be told what to do or prescribed a solution, especially developers, who are used to a lot of autonomy (usually they get to choose their own tools at work)
						- There is a basic psychological reaction in which they will just shut down and stop listening
						- Despite how much control the other engineers have on the process, they need to *feel* like they have input, and *feel* heard
						- It's like percieved performance, except percieved involvement
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Ask.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Listen.</li>
						<li class="fragment tomato">Make Your User Feel Heard.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					  - I really want to emphasize this third point, of making your user feel heard
					  - which brings me to my next point...
				</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/grocery.jpg">
					<h1>3. Buy-in</h1>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- For all of the reasons I just went over, good communication is really important for getting buy-in from your users
						- You also need to get buy-in from product managment and design. 
						- It's a lot of people ops, which we'll hear a lot about in the next talk
						- You have to make them *want* to use your design system because then you can really win
						- & a really good way to get someome to want to use a product is to make it the path of least resistance, to *show* its value
						- *Showing* is more powerful than *telling*
						- So if you can, have developers use your product in a low-stakes situation where it provides clear benefits
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Hackathons are Candy to a Budding Design System</h3>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Hackathons are a great place to debut your design system
						- Having a hackathon internally at DigitalOcean was a perfect opportunity to:
						1. Evangelize for the design system
						2. See what people were using it for and struggling with (excellent user testing there)
						3. Get user feedback afterward on how to improve it
						- The feedback we got from that hackathon was really helpful in shaping what's become of our current iteration</aside>

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- After the hackathon, more people had heard about BUI, and word spread. 
						- This was my favorite moment that occured a few weeks after the hackathon. //explain + click
						- These kinds of moments, where people explore on their own are where you can really get people on your side and using the design system, 
						- helping their products scale and grow
						- seeing the benefits first hand
						- Speaking of seeing products scale and grow...
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/architecture.jpg">
					<h1>4. Solid Architecture</h1>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Build it so that it can grow
						- Not collide with existing styles (via namespacing or using a component framework that does that for you)
						- Versioning
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>
					<p>Major.Minor.Patch</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- I've used Semantic versioning on all of the design systems I've ever worked on
						- It uses a system of Major.Minor.Patch for any updates
						- You can then tag released on Github with versioned updates and ensure that someone's app won't break unintentionally when there is an update
						- We also use this semantic versioning as a link with our design system assets to keep them in sync, with the same version number corresponding to both Sketch and code
						- For our built CDN assets, I'll talk about that more in a second, we run a deploy script that automatically created folders for each realease, as well as a `latest` folder if someone wanted the always-up-to-date version of the design system
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="img/brainpixel.jpg">
					 <h1>5. Reduce Friction</h1> 
					<p>If it's harder for people to use than their current system, people won't use it</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Reducing friction kind of sums up all of the other points made here about empathy, communication, and thinking about your user when building a design system
						- You have to make your design system the path of least resistance, 
						- and that means lowering cognitive overhead of development, not adding to it
						- this could change some of the decisions you make, but if your design system is complicated and over-engineered, again, its not going to be used
						- With the new version of BUI, we provide a few options
						- Option 1, where users can implement it into a development environment and use Sass, select just the components they want to include, and extend the system using hooks.
						- That's the most performant and extensible output. Code is clean and everyone's happy.
						- But not everyone wants to work this way, including Sass a dependancy and learning a new syntax.
						- There is also the user who just wants to throw a link onto their page and have it look nice, and thats where our versioned built assets come in
						- What you want (option 1) may not be the path of least resistance for an engineer, and you always have to keep that user in mind

        <section>
          <h2>You Might Not Need A Design System.</h2>
          <aside class="notes">This is controversial because there is this push that everyone needs a design system. But its like the JavaScript framework React. React is a great solution, but its not the *right* solution for every project. </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
              I did mention above that a design system can't be succesful without buy-in and coordination, so here is me providing a warning that a design system cannot be a one-person effort. If you're inspired by this talk and go back to your company and start building a design system, they might not know what to do with it. It might be a massive amount of work falling on deaf ears. It's really important to know your audience and your toolset. A design system might not be the best use of your time. If you're working on a small project
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          The best time to build a design system is while a product is evolving, but they can be built in retrospect as well. The earlier the better, so its just something you have to manage.
